# About HRC.ART

Welcome to my digital canvas! I'm Henry Condon, a multidisciplinary artist and technologist exploring the intersection of creativity and computation.

## My Journey

With a background spanning both traditional art and modern technology, I've always been fascinated by how these two worlds collide and complement each other. My work explores themes of digital transformation, interactive experiences, and the beauty of algorithmic art.

## What I Do

- **Digital Art**: Creating immersive digital experiences
- **Creative Coding**: Using code as a medium for artistic expression
- **Interactive Installations**: Bridging the physical and digital worlds
- **Experimental Projects**: Pushing the boundaries of what's possible

## Let's Connect

I'm always excited to collaborate on interesting projects or discuss ideas. Feel free to reach out through the [contact page](/hrc.art/contact) or connect with me on social media.
